âš¡ Energy Consumption Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project presents a machine learning-based system for short-term residential electricity consumption forecasting. Using a multi-regional dataset enriched with contextual metadata, the system benchmarks the performance of three popular models Random Forest,XGBoost, and LSTM and deploys the best-performing one via a user-friendly Streamlit application.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
